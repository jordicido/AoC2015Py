# Advent of Code 2015 - Python

This repository is my way to practice Python and algorythms and structures by solving the Advent of Code challenge of 2015.

Advent of code is a yearly challenge that has 25 challenges (divided in two parts each day) and starts the 1st of December.

You can do it daily during that days or (just in my case) you can solve those challenges in any other moment.

A part from solving the challenges I'll try to understand and research on what is being asked each day in order to have a better comprehension of complex algorythms.

## Challenges

* [Day 1: Not Quite Lisp](https://github.com/jordicido/AoC2015Py/blob/main/day1.py)
  * 1st part: Simple loop
  * 2nd part: Simple loop with stop condition
* [Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math](https://github.com/jordicido/AoC2015Py/blob/main/day2.py)
  * 1st part: Simple loop
  * 2nd part: Simple loop
* [Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum](https://github.com/jordicido/AoC2015Py/blob/main/day3.py)
  * 1st part: Positions visited while traversing a two dimensional array
  * 2nd part: Positions visited while traversing a two dimensional array
* [Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer](https://github.com/jordicido/AoC2015Py/blob/main/day4.py)
